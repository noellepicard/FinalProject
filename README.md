# FinalProject

This project is pulling data from Kangerlussuac plant abundances in grazing and non-grazing regions (exclosures). Data was filtered by removing NA values and removing any plant types that have an abundance mean of < 1. The biplot shows trends in abundances of each plant type with the color of each point representing if the plants are grazed or not (pulled from plot C). The biplot showed that Betula nana abundances were decreased from grazing in section C, graminoid abundances were increased in grazing regions in section C, and forb sum abundances were unaffected by grazing. The plots for these 3 plant types have color represent grazing and exclosure treatments and the shapes represent warmed and ambient treatments. All plots were made from section C and around the Bashful control.
